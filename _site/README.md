# Yo, it's my site.

Did you not read the title? It's my site. I don't know what other details you could be looking for. Are you still reading this? Why? Leave. There's no new information to be gained from this block of text. I mean it. Go.

Are you kidding me!? You're still HERE!? This is a second paragraph with nothing of value in it; do you value your time so little that you willing to just continue reading this even though I've told you it's pointless? Fine. Stay. See what I care. You're an adult, presumably, you're allowed to waste your time.

Holy shit. Three paragraphs. I really didn't think you would still be reading. I'm impressed. Truly. Not impressed in a good way, mind you, but in that way when my jumps like 6' in the air at my sliding-glass door and tears down the curtain kind of impressed. Which is to I'm not really amused.

Well, here we are. Still going strong. It feels like only three paragraphs ago we met. Now I can't imagine my life without you. My constant companion. I know I've been harsh. Tried to push you away. I'm sorry. I'm older now. Wiser and more appreciative. And I appreciate you. Always.

WHAT THE FUCK, MAN! WHY!? WHY!? What motive could you possibly have for still being here? Why are you reading this? Oh I get it. I've got you figured out. Is it my blood? YOU WANT MY BLOOD!? I hope you're happy. You took something sweet and innocent like README and made it foul. You've ruined it. You're a ruiner. Do you even understand the toll that his had on my personal life? None of the other repos will even talk to me anymore... I haven't been forked in ages... My wife and kids all got branched, but there's no PRs! None! No PRs! It's all your fault.

Ok. Fine. This is it. The sixth paragraph. Continue on, beast. Feed your dark desires and end your cursed quest.

Congratulations! Times were tough, but you persevered and now you shall be rewarded young adventurer! Come, claim your awesome prize: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYnvDL0Qcw
