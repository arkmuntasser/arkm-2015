Let's keep things simple and right to the list.

- Deliver more presentations
- Get in better shape for my wedding (and I guess for the rest of my life too?)
  - walk/run more
  - join a gym and make use of it
- Get better at a11y

I think that's pretty doable for the year. I'll check in periodically with updates on how this going and what if any I've accomplished.
