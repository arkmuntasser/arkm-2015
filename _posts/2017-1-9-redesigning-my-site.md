Let’s talk about sex, baby. And by sex, I mean my new website and not sex at all because our personal lives are just that unless the person reading this is, at the time of me writing this, my fiancée then what’s up?

##### Design
I’m not a designer. Let’s just start there. At one time I wanted to be and even referred to myself as one, but I just am not one. And that ok, because for not being a designer I think I have a pretty good eye for what’s good looking.

I’ve made and remade my site a number of times over the years and never been happy with the result until now. I finally found the right fonts, colors, and layout that works and helps tell the story of me.

I think a large part of it was to just embrace the fact that I’m a geek and my site should reflect that.

##### Backend
This is a static site generated via Jekyll hosted on GitHub pages. I chose Jekyll because it’s simple and I wanted a no-fuss way to get a site and running. I don’t need a whole CMS for my personal site. Aside from the blog, I don’t intend to update very much very often. And where the blog is concerned I would much rather just upload a markdown file and call it a day than mess with some RTE that’s going to riddle my content with BS HTML tags.

Though this is a static Jekyll site, that doesn’t mean there aren’t cool things going on under the hood. For example, this site has a service worker. Does it need one? No, of course not. I mostly just wanted to learn about service workers and the best way to learn is to do. So, if you’re in Chrome or FF (I think) you should be able to view this offline.

There are a number of improvement I am looking to make to the site going forward. For example, from an accessibility perspective, I am really dropping the ball in many ways. I hope to rectify that in the not too distant future. And I am sure as time goes on I’ll think of a number of bells and whistles to add, but for the launch I really trimmed the site down to the basics.

##### Sections
I decided that there were 4 areas that I wanted to focus on for my site: main banner, projects, blog, and resume.

###### 1. Main Banner
This is the first major element of the site and I wanted it to be something that would instantly give the visitor a sense of who I was. Rather than have some static image and pithy catchphrase I wanted something that could change and give an insight into my personality. What better than to link it up to my Twitter.

Technically, it’s not actually connected to my Twitter at all. It’s connected to my Instagram. That’s because it’s easier to grab the url for an image on Instagram than it is on Twitter, but when I post to Instagram those get reposted on Twitter natively anyway. And since I primarily use Twitter, I don’t think it’s unfair to refer to this as my “Twitter” banner.

###### 2. Projects
Next are my favorite GitHub projects. I am always spinning up repos for new ideas and they are were I do most of my learning. If you wanted to get to know me as a developer, then my work is where you should start.

###### 3. Blog
I don’t really blog and never really have. But I’ve always wanted to do. I’ve had various blogs on Tumblr and Blogspot back in the day, but those never really did it for me. I could never get into the community those site were built around. My hope is that by having my blog here with no expectation of a community that I might actually get to using it to actually journal my life.

I’m not sure what the balance between personal and professional will be yet, but I’m sure I’ll figure it out as I go.

###### 4. Resume
This is just to provide my bonafides as a developer and show off some of the work I am most proud of having the opportunity to work on and/or lead the development of.

##### Finale
So there you have it. A quick break down of my new site. If you have any questions you can tweet at me or email me. Please don’t actually email me because that would be terrible and I’m sure not going to respond to you so just tweet me.
