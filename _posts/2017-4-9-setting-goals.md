Set some goals. That sounds simple enough. But it’s one of the hardest things for people to do. That’s because, I’ve noticed, people tend to set bad, unachievable goals that set them up for failure.

So, what exactly is a bad goal? Here’s a goal that one of my employees told me he set for himself, “I want to be the best developer.” That is a pretty typical goal that I hear and it’s probably one of the worst goals you can have. It sounds good, sure, to be “the best,” but what does that even mean? How do you quantify “the best?” What steps do you take to become “the best?”

If a goal cannot be measured and clear defined steps cannot be made to achieve that goal, then it’s a bad goal. It may be a noble goal, but in practice it will only serve to create stress and promote the imposter syndrome feeling that is common among junior developers. So you need to set goals; not just for yourself, but your individual employees and the team as a whole as well.

Now that we know what a bad goal looks like, let’s see what a good goal looks like. As I’ve stated already the ability measure progress and create a clearly defined plan to achieve your goal is an absolute must when coming up with your goals. An example of a good goal for a web developer would be to develop a deep understanding of accessibility. Notice I’m not say to become an expert in this category, but just to develop a deep understanding. You know when you understand something. You can explain it. You can teach it. That’s a clearly defined goal that can be measured. And we can plan out how to achieve that goal. You can learn about various accessibility auditing tools that exist, you can learn about the WAI-ARIA spec, and you can learn more about HTML5 semantics. This may seem like a much smaller goal compared to wanting to be “the best,” but it’s a much more powerful goal. Let’s consider the 3 examples of actions that can be taken to develop an understanding of accessibility on the web.

Learning how to use accessibility auditing tools will expose a developer to more tool sets and workflows that are tried and true which will in turn lead to better habits in production. It will also expose them to more advanced use of tools they are already familiar with such as the Dev Tools in the browser. These are skills that were learned for the sake of accessibility, but can be applied to anything and will ultimately make the developer general better at being a developer.

Learning about the WAI-ARIA spec will get a developer used to reading a lot of documentation which, in my experience, they are not used to having to do. Reading a spec can give them deeper insights into the quirks and weeds-y details of modern web development. It also makes them more comfortable with reading documentation in general which means they can more easily leverage new or unfamiliar technology and tools to aid them in production. Once again, they gained a valuable skill that will make them a better developer over all by simply trying to learn a single concept.

Finally, learning about HTML5 semantics will help reduce div-itis. It will make the developer more aware of how well structured markup can help SEO. Also it will teach them about proper hierarchy of content when using h tags. Yet again we can see how the goal of learning a single facet of web development can expose the developer to many concepts outside the narrow scope of the goal that all serve to make the developer better all around.

If someone truly wants to be “the best,” this is how they should go about it. Narrower, focused, achievable, measurable goals.

So, go set some goals. Set goals for yourself. Set goals for your team members. And even set goals for the team as a unit. Let me know how it works out for you.
