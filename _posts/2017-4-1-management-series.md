Well this whole blog thing has not worked out like I thought it would. I really thought I would be a lot more involved with it, but I guess not. So to force myself to make this a regular habit I'm turning it into a job. Not one to make money, but rather to enrich myself in another way. A spiritual way. So I will be creating a post once a month in a series I'm calling *Developer Managing*.

*Developer Managing* is going to be a look at things I've learned as a manager of a development team and my process for handling various situations from code problems, employee problems, to inter-departmental problems. I am in no way THE authority in any of these subject, but I would say it's fair to consider me AN authority.

You might really enjoy what I have to say and you might find it to be complete bullshit. That's ok. It's working out well for me and that's really all that matters.

When the first in the series comes out later this month I will be looking at how to create proper goals for yourself and for your team. Every person and team needs a direction and it's important not to get hung up on ideas that just spin you around in circles.

So look out for that because it's coming. I promise. (I'm already writing it. I have a pretty good portion worked out too!)
