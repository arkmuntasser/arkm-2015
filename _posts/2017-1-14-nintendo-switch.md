Nintendo finally fully reveled their new console, the Nintendo Switch. I have been infatuated with it ever since. I mean, just look at it! That has to be the prettiest looking console every. I thought the Xbox One S was sleek, but this thing is on a whole other level.

I will admit, I am a sucker for the bright colorful controllers. They really do it for me. There's a console that is all black and it' just not as attractive. I can't wait to pick this up when it drops this March.

Now let's just hope the software is at least half as pretty though I know that's a lot to ask with Nintendo's record on UI design.

<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:57%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/FondNegligibleBunny' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<div class="sep"></div>

But the couple seconds the UI was shown does make me optimistic. Of course this will almost certainly change before release and continue to be even more different post release. Oh well, a girl can dream.
