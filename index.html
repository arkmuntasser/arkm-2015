          I'm Amir. I'm a CMS Production Lead Developer at <a href="http://simpleviewinc.com" target="_blank" title="Simpleview" rel="noopener">Simpleview</a>. I build websites for the tourism industry; in fact two of my sites were in the <a href="https://skift.com/2016/07/13/the-25-best-tourism-websites-in-the-world-in-2016/" target="_blank" title="The 25 Best Tourism Websites in the World in 2016" rel="noopener">top 25 tourism websites of 2016</a> which was pretty damn cool. Check them out when you've got a free moment: <a href="http://visitnorway.com" target="_blank" title="Visit Norway" rel="noopener">Visit Norway</a> and <a href="http://experiencecolumbus.com" target="_blank" title="Experience Columbus" rel="noopener">Experience Columbus</a>.

        <p>
          When I'm not building websites, I am usually chillin' with my homies and my main man, The Monarch. Which is totally not code for just playing video games with my fiancÃ©e, ðŸ˜‰.

            This is my current gig. Simpleview is the market leader in digital solutions for the tourism industry. I lead a production team, we're the ones who build the websites. I created our code style guide and present on topics such as performant web animations and progressive enhancement.

            I was contracted to work on their redesign. I worked on some backend code to handle user profile updates and show/season routes. The site was built on the LAMP stack using Laravel.

            I was brought on board to finish development of their website. I ended up doing a complete responsive redesign. The site is built on top of the Magento CMS and estore.
